## Concrete actions (1-2) and practices (3)
1. Work with the team. Gather knowledge about: 
    - current processes
    - amount of bugs per sprint
    - priorities of bugs
    - time to fix bugs
    - most vulnerable areas (BE, FE, features)
    - areas of QA which doesn't covered enough (performance, security)
    - check status and areas covered/uncovered by automation tests
    - check status of tech debt (amount of finished tech debt should be bigger than added)
    - how often task goes back to In Progress from QA"				
2. Gather with the team and decide paint point. Introduce/propose metrcis  based on 1 and agree to follow them				
3. Gather team and decide on the first techniques which team will try out:
    - Focus testers on high risk (developers test themselves and ask help if needed)
    - Create pre-development testing notes (QA only creates notes about what to test, which types of bugs to expect - developer actualy creates and run tests)
    - QA kick off (QA and DEV pairs together and brainstorm about what to test, what to focus on, which types of bugs are expected)
    - Developer on test (developers take turn and handle testing activities)
    - Question checklist (if developers ask QA too much questions it means it is time to create checklist on what DEV can ask QA)
    - QA Demo (review progress with the developer, provide feedback/risks/ideas to test)
    - Cross automation (QA define tests, developer automates)
    - Paired exploration (DEV and QA)
    - Blitz test or Bug hunting (short period of time when people work together to break the feature)
    - Risk storming or War room with postmortem (group analysis of risks and hot to mitigate them)
    - Dogfooding (use feature internally before your users)
    - Internal testing or Fresh blood testing (group of people which are rarely involved into testing or newcomers group)
    ### Product level:   
    - Bug reviews
    - Testing tours 
    ### Organization level:
    - Fixit days
    - Rotate QA across the teams
    - Testing fair (QA demo new tools, ideas, approaches)
